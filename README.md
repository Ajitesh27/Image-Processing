# Image-Processing
4th sem Linear Algebra project on Image processing.

Image processing is an interesting application of linear algebra. Every image can be
represented in the form of a matrix. This matrix when multiplied with transformation
matrices can help to transform an image .Each transformation has its own transformation
matrix which when multiplied with the original matrix transforms it into a new transformed
matrix. There are various types of transformations like rotation,reflection (or
flipping),shearing,stretching,flipping etc. With the help of computers and algorithms an
image can be converted into a matrix and then transformed by multiplying with the
corresponding transformation matrix. We have implemented a program using C++ to perform
these transformations.
